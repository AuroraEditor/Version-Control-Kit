    /// It is useful for tracking branch history and provides the names of branches
    /// that were either checked out or renamed.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - directoryURL: The URL of the Git repository.
    ///   - limit: The maximum number of recently checked out branches to retrieve.
    ///
    /// - Returns: An array of branch names that were recently checked out or renamed, with a maximum count of `limit`.
    ///
    /// - Throws: An error if there was an issue executing the Git log command or if the output couldn't be parsed.
    ///

    ///     looking for branch checkout and rename events.

    ///   ```swift
    ///   let repositoryURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/path/to/git/repo")
    ///   let recentBranches = try getRecentBranches(directoryURL: repositoryURL, limit: 5)
