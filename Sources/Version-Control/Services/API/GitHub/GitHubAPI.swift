    /// This function allows the user to create a new GitHub repository either under their 
    /// own account or within an organization. It provides parameters for specifying the repository's name,
    /// description, and whether it should be private or public.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - org: An optional `IAPIOrganization` object representing the organization where the repository \
    ///          should be created. Pass `nil` to create the repository under the authenticated user's account.
    ///   - name: The name of the new repository.
    ///   - description: A brief description of the repository.
    ///   - isPrivate: A Boolean flag indicating whether the repository should be private (`true`) or public (`false`).
    ///   - completion: A closure that is called upon completion of the API request. \
    ///                 It provides a `Result` object with either an `IAPIFullRepository` \

    ///       name: "my-new-repo",
