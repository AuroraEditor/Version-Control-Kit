     * optional in the API response. So we're lying a bit to the type system
     * here saying that this will be present but the only time the difference
     * between omission and explicit undefined matters is when using constructs
     * like `x in y` or `y.hasOwnProperty('x')` which we do very rarely.
     *
     * Without at least one non-optional type in this interface TypeScript will
     * happily let us pass an IAPIRepository in place of an IAPIFullRepository.
